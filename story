** story **
Once upon a time, in a forest, there lived a monkey who resided on a berry tree, which was on the bank of a river. In the same forest, 
there lived a crocodile and his wife. One day, the crocodile came to the bank of the river and rested under the tree. The kind-hearted monkey 
offered him some fruits. The crocodile and the monkey became good friends. However, when the crocodile returned home, his wife didn't approve him
 and the monkey becoming friends. She explained that crocodiles are supposed to be carnivores (meat eaters) and he was expected to bring the monkey 
 home as supper for a scrumptious and delightful meal. The crocodile refused to do such a thing and stormed out of the house to discuss the situation
 with his new monkey friend. The monkey said to not panic and came up with a cunning plan. The next day, the wife came to the bank of the river and rested under a tree.
 That tree happened to be the very same tree in which the monkey was living in and when he spotted the crocodile's wife, he did the same thing as he did the day before for the crocodile and offered his wife some delicious fruits. The wife happened to be hungry at that time and thought of the monkey as a yummy snack. Fortunately, the monkey's kindess had  
 affected the crocodile's heart and she felt touched at his generosity and so, accepted the fruits. They too, became good friends and all lived happily ever after.
